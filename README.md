Objective:
The repository is a learning exercise to:

Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set


The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

Identifying the problem and Data Sources
Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-Processing the Data
Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

Construct predictive models to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. 
In this notebook, I construct a predictive model using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. 
The diagnosis of a breast tumor is a binary variable (benign or malignant). 
I also evaluate the model using confusion matrix the receiver operating curves (ROC), which are essential in assessing and interpreting the fitted model.

IMPROVING THE MODEL

Construct predictive models to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor. In this notebook, I aim to tune parameters of the SVM Classification model using scikit-learn.
